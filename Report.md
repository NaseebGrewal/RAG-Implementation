# Short Report: Document Ingestion, Indexing, Retrieval, and Prompt Design

## üîç Document Ingestion, Indexing, and Retrieval

The system is built around a simple **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline for identifying organizations with potential financial crime risks.

### 1. Document Ingestion:
- The dataset is read from a plain text file containing fictional organization profiles.
- A regular expression pattern is used to extract document IDs, titles, and descriptions.

### 2. Vectorization & Embedding:
- A SentenceTransformer model (`BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5`) is used to embed each document.
- Texts are concatenated into the format `"Title: Description"` and then embedded into dense vectors.

### 3. Indexing using FAISS:
- All embeddings are added to a FAISS `IndexFlatL2` index for efficient similarity search.
- Each document‚Äôs metadata is stored in a `id_to_docs` dictionary, keyed by the FAISS index position.

### 4. Query Retrieval:
- The same SentenceTransformer model is used to embed the user query.
- FAISS returns the top-k closest documents based on vector similarity.
- The titles and descriptions of these documents are formatted into context for the LLM.

## Prompt Design & Experiments

The final prompt sent to the LLM is constructed in a clear instruction-following format:

```
<s>[INST] Your task is to analyse the question based on the context and provide a suitable answer.

Context:
<top-k document info>

Question: <query>

Answer: [/INST]
```

- This format follows the **ChatML-style** used by Mistral-Instruct models.
- Experiments showed that wrapping context and instructions explicitly improved the clarity and structure of generated answers.
- The use of `return_full_text=False` in the Hugging Face API ensured that only the generated answer was returned, keeping the response clean.

---

## Observations on Prompt Impact

- **Structured prompts** like `[INST]...[/INST]` helped Mistral understand and follow instructions better.
- **Vague or minimal prompts** often led to generic answers with hallucinated content.
- Adding context in a bullet or numbered format didn‚Äôt help significantly over the current structure.
- Using `max_new_tokens=512` provided sufficient response length without overwhelming output.
