    "- **PromptStyle Enum:**  \n",

    "  - **STANDARD:** Basic prompt combining context and query.\n",
    "  - **FEW_SHOT:** Adds a few recent Q&A examples to guide the model.\n",
    "  - **CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT:** Encourages step-by-step reasoning.\n",
    "  - **ROLE_BASED:** Frames the query in the context of domain expertise (e.g., forensic investigator).\n",
    "  - **BULLET_POINTS:** Instructs the model to summarize findings in bullet points.\n",
    "  - **SCORING:** Requests the model to score each organization based on risk and provide explanations.\n",

    "  2. **Handling Optional History:**  \n",

Insider trading: If Blue Horizon Investments' employees or associates have access to non-public information about a company, they could use this information to make trades before the information is publicly available.

Irregular transaction patterns, such as large, unusual trades, could indicate an attempt to manipulate the market price of a security. For example, a large purchase of a security could artificially inflate the price, allowing insiders to sell at a profit before the price reverts to its true value.\n",
