    "## Chunk-Based Indexing Pipeline Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This section demonstrates a scalable, production-grade implementation of a text indexing pipeline that combines document chunking, batch embedding, and efficient FAISS indexing. The goal is to enable high-performance nearest neighbor search over large text corpora, suitable for real-world deployments.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Environment Setup and Constants:**\n",
    "   - **Environment Variables:** Uses `dotenv` to load configuration parameters such as the file path (`FILE_PATH`) from a dedicated `.env` file.\n",
    "   - **Constants:** Defines important constants including the model name (`MODEL_NAME`) and the output path for the FAISS index (`INDEX_PATH`).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Document Loading and Chunk Splitting (`load_and_split_documents`):**\n",
    "   - **Functionality:** Reads the entire raw text from the specified file.\n",
    "   - **Chunking:** Utilizes LangChain's `RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` to split the document into manageable chunks while preserving context through configurable chunk size and overlap.\n",
    "   - **Advantage:** This approach prevents memory overload and maintains semantic continuity across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Batch Embedding of Text Chunks (`embed_text_chunks`):**\n",
    "   - **Embedding Model:** Leverages a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model to generate vector embeddings.\n",
    "   - **Batch Processing:** Embeds text chunks in batches (using a batch size of 64) for optimized performance and reduced memory usage.\n",
    "   - **Output:** Returns the embeddings as a `numpy.ndarray` with `float32` precision, ready for indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **FAISS Index Creation (`create_chunk_based_faiss_index`):**\n",
    "   - **Index Type:** Employs a FAISS `IndexHNSWFlat` index, which is well-suited for high-dimensional, large-scale nearest neighbor search.\n",
    "   - **Index Configuration:** Configures HNSW parameters (e.g., `efConstruction`) for optimal indexing performance.\n",
    "   - **Persistence:** Writes the index to disk (`INDEX_PATH`), ensuring that the index can be reloaded without the need for re-computation, making the solution production-ready.\n",
    "   - **Feedback:** Prints out the total number of indexed chunks for validation and monitoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Production Benefits\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability:**  \n",
    "  Chunking and batch processing allow the pipeline to efficiently handle large documents by breaking them into smaller, manageable pieces.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Performance:**  \n",
    "  The FAISS HNSW index supports fast, approximate nearest neighbor searches, enabling real-time query responses even with extensive datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability:**  \n",
    "  Modularity of functions (chunking, embedding, indexing) simplifies debugging, testing, and future enhancements. Persisting the index on disk further facilitates quick restarts and continuous operations in a production environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "This robust architectural design lays a solid foundation for a production-grade document retrieval system, ensuring both performance and scalability."
