    "## Prompt Generation Strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "This cell introduces multiple strategies for constructing prompts tailored to various language model inference tasks. The design is intended to offer flexibility and control over how context and queries are combined, which is especially valuable when fine-tuning interactions with large language models.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Components\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PromptStyle Enum:**  \n",
    "  An enumeration (`PromptStyle`) is defined to encapsulate different prompt formatting strategies, including:\n",
    "  - **STANDARD:** Basic prompt combining context and query.\n",
    "  - **FEW_SHOT:** Adds a few recent Q&A examples to guide the model.\n",
    "  - **CHAIN_OF_THOUGHT:** Encourages step-by-step reasoning.\n",
    "  - **ROLE_BASED:** Frames the query in the context of domain expertise (e.g., forensic investigator).\n",
    "  - **BULLET_POINTS:** Instructs the model to summarize findings in bullet points.\n",
    "  - **SCORING:** Requests the model to score each organization based on risk and provide explanations.\n",
    "  - **CHATML:** Utilizes a ChatML-style formatting for models that require it.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **generate_prompt Function:**  \n",
    "  This function constructs the final prompt by:\n",
    "  1. **Aggregating Context:**  \n",
    "     Joins multiple context documents with clear separation.\n",
    "  2. **Handling Optional History:**  \n",
    "     For few-shot prompting, it appends recent Q&A pairs to enrich the prompt.\n",
    "  3. **Conditionally Formatting the Prompt:**  \n",
    "     Checks the selected `prompt_style` and formats the prompt accordingly, ensuring:\n",
    "     - **Clarity & Structure:** Each version clearly lays out the context, query, and expected model behavior.\n",
    "     - **Adaptability:** Different styles serve different purposes depending on the inference task at hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "This modular approach allows data scientists to experiment with and select the most effective prompting style for their specific use case, helping optimize the quality and relevance of model responses."

       "1. **High Volume of Cross-Border Transactions**: Aurora Financial Services has recorded an unusually high number of transactions that involve transferring money across national borders. This in itself can be a red flag, especially if these transactions lack a clear and legitimate business purpose.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Opaque Justifications**: The transactions are described as having \"opaque justifications,\" meaning that the reasons given for conducting these transactions are unclear or not easily understandable. Legitimate businesses typically provide transparent and easily verifiable purposes for their cross-border transactions. Lack of clarity can indicate attempts to disguise the true nature of the transactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Concerns Over Money Laundering**: The patterns identified—high volume and lack of transparency—are commonly associated with money laundering activities. Criminal organizations often use cross-border transactions to obscure the origin of illicit funds, making it difficult for authorities to trace where the money has come from and where it is going. This can include layering the money through numerous transactions in different jurisdictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Analyst Flags**: The fact that analysts have specifically flagged these patterns suggests that there is a level of scrutiny from financial oversight entities or compliance officers who are concerned that the activities may not align with standard operational procedures in the financial industry.\n",
       "\n",

       "<div style='white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;'>To analyze how the transaction patterns of Blue Horizon Investments suggest possible insider trading or market manipulation, we can break down the elements as follows:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Irregular Transaction Patterns**: \n",
       "   - The term \"irregular transaction patterns\" points to trading behaviors that deviate from what would be considered normal market activity for a firm of their profile. For instance, if a company typically trades in smaller volumes and suddenly executes large trades or trades in a stock that has low historical trading volume, this can be suspicious.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Rapid Fund Movements**: \n",
       "   - The mention of “rapid” and “unexplained” fund movements implies that funds are being shifted in ways that do not correlate with usual investment behavior or strategies. For example, if large sums are transferred between accounts or to different entities without clear justification or correlation to market events, this raises red flags.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Temporal Correlation with Market Events**:\n",
       "   - If these irregular transactions and fund movements occur just before significant announcements (such as mergers, acquisitions, or earnings reports), this could indicate that the firm is trading based on non-public, material information. This timing is a classic hallmark of insider trading.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Volume and Price Fluctuation Analysis**:\n",
       "   - An increase in trading volume in conjunction with unusual price movements in the stocks involved could signal manipulative practices. If the firm’s activities lead to significant price changes that later revert, this might suggest market manipulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Possible Access to Non-Public Information**:\n",
       "   - The irregularities might indicate that individuals within Blue Horizon Investments are exploiting their position to gain access to non-public information about companies or markets, which they then utilize for personal profit or to benefit the firm unfairly.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Historical Patterns**:\n",
       "   - If historical data shows that similar patterns of trading precede a pattern of favorable outcomes or financial gains for the firm, this could further substantiate suspicions of insider trading or manipulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Lack of Transparency**:\n",
       "   - Given that these actions are described as \"irregular\" and \"unexplained,\" it suggests a lack of transparency in the firm's investment practices, which may be a tactic to obscure unethical behavior.\n",
       "\n",

       "<div style='white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;'>To compare the descriptions of Falcon Secure Bank and Helix Fintech Solutions in terms of transparency and regulatory compliance, we can analyze several key aspects of their operations outlined in their descriptions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Type of Institution**:\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank**: It is a digital-only institution, which suggests a focus on technology-driven services. Being digital-only, it may likely have a more centralized and controlled environment for implementing compliance measures.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions**: This is a rapidly growing startup in the financial technology space. Startups often face challenges in scaling their compliance practices alongside growth which can lead to inconsistencies.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Cybersecurity and Auditing**:\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank**: The description highlights its \"cutting-edge cybersecurity\" and \"rigorous internal audits.\" These elements indicate a strong internal control environment, which is crucial for maintaining regulatory compliance and transparency. Regular audits can help identify potential issues and ensure accountability.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions**: In contrast, there is mention of a \"patchwork of compliance practices,\" suggesting that the organization has not established a consistent or comprehensive approach to compliance. This raises concerns about transparency and regulatory adherence.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Compliance Practices**:\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank**: It is noted for \"strong compliance practices\" which contribute to a perception of reliability. Strong compliance practices imply adherence to regulatory requirements, and thorough training of staff, and they often involve ongoing assessments to ensure organizations meet legal standards.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions**: The reference to \"internal reviews for potential fraud and mismanagement of client funds\" indicates that the company is at risk of lacking proper compliance mechanisms. This foxes the issue that compliance practices may be reactive rather than proactive, further undermining the perception of transparency.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Regulatory Trust**:\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank**: The bank has \"earned the trust of its customers and regulators alike,\" indicating that it is viewed favorably by both stakeholders. High trust levels often correlate with effective communication of practices and readiness to comply with regulations.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions**: The issues surrounding partnerships with \"unregulated advisors\" point to a reputation that may be scrutinized or doubted by regulators and clients, affecting trust. Unregulated advisors can lead to conflicts of interest and pose risks to client funds, undermining confidence in the company's operations.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Overall Reputation**:\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank**: Its accolades for cutting-edge practices and transparency bolster its reputation, positioning it as a reliable and compliant institution.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions**: The need for internal reviews due to potential fraud and mismanagement reveals vulnerability and gaps in its operational integrity, which negatively impacts its reputation.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, Falcon Secure Bank's emphasis on cybersecurity, rigorous audits, and strong compliance practices, along with its established trust with customers and regulators, contribute to its perceived higher transparency and regulatory compliance compared to Helix Fintech Solutions, which faces challenges related to inconsistent compliance practices and potential fraud risks.</div>"

       "<div style='white-space: pre-wrap; word-wrap: break-word;'>Cascade Capital Management presents several potential risk indicators that merit further investigation. Here is an analysis based on the provided context:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Complex Network of Subsidiaries**: The use of a complex web of subsidiary shell companies can often be indicative of a lack of transparency. This structure may be employed to obscure the flow of funds, which can facilitate financial crimes such as money laundering or tax evasion. Regulatory scrutiny is a common outcome when firms utilize such structures, as it raises questions about the legitimacy of their operations and financial reporting.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Growth and Expansion**: While rapid growth can be a positive indicator of success, it can also lead to management oversights, inadequate compliance controls, and a greater risk of operational vulnerabilities. If Cascade Capital Management has expanded quickly without corresponding enhancements in its governance structure, it may be more susceptible to financial misreporting or fraud.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Regulatory Scrutiny**: The fact that Cascade Capital Management is already under regulatory scrutiny suggests that there are ongoing concerns about its financial practices. This scrutiny can result from whistleblower complaints, suspicious financial activities, or routine compliance checks. Ongoing investigations could expose the firm to reputational damage and potential legal consequences.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Sector Risks**: As a venture capital firm focused on tech investments, Cascade Capital Management is inherently exposed to sector-specific risks, including valuation discrepancies, high volatility, and increased competition. These factors can lead to aggressive financial practices that may not align with regulatory expectations.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Lack of Transparency**: High reliance on subsidiary shell companies can indicate obfuscation. A thorough review of financial transactions and ownership structures is necessary to identify any signs of illicit activities or inefficiencies in financial reporting.\n",
       "\n",
       "Overall, Cascade Capital Management's operational structure and its rapid expansion pose potential risks that require careful scrutiny. Investigating the flow of funds, the purpose of the subsidiaries, and any potential connections to other entities under investigation will be crucial to assessing the firm's compliance and risk profile.</div>"

       "1. **Gemini Asset Management**: The unusually high commissions and inconsistent portfolio reporting can indicate a lack of transparency and potential attempts to obscure the true nature of transactions. Coupled with serving high-net-worth clients, this raises red flags regarding money laundering, particularly if the source of funds for these clients is not well-documented.\n",

The use of such structures often raises concerns about transparency and compliance, especially in the context of financial regulations. The rapid growth and reliance on these entities could suggest attempts to facilitate money laundering activities by complicating the ownership and financial trails.\n",
       "\n",
       "While **Aurora Financial Services** has recorded high volumes of cross-border transactions with opaque justifications, the primary risk indicator here relates to transactional behavior rather than structural complexity.

The following are the specific irregular transaction patterns identified and the reasons these raise concerns about potential money laundering:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **High Volume of Cross-Border Transactions**: The firm has seen a significant increase in transactions crossing international borders, especially if these transactions deviate from typical business practices. This is often a red flag, as high volumes can facilitate the movement of illicit funds across jurisdictions.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Opaque Justifications**: The lack of clear explanations for these cross-border transactions raises suspicion. Legitimate financial transactions typically have well-documented purposes, such as investments, payments for goods and services, or proper client instructions. When justifications are unclear or vague, it suggests the possibility of efforts to conceal the origins or destinations of funds.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Unusual Recipient and Origin Countries**: If transactions are often routed through or directed to countries known for banking secrecy, high levels of corruption, or poor anti-money laundering controls—often referred to as high-risk jurisdictions—it could indicate an attempt to hide illicit funds.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Inconsistencies with Client Profiles**: If the transaction volumes do not align with the expected transactional behavior of clients based on their profiles (such as type of business, income level, or geographic location) this discrepancy can be another indicator of potential money laundering.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Rapid Fluctuations in Transaction Amounts**: Significant fluctuations in transaction amounts without a clear underlying business justification could suggest layering, a process in money laundering where the origins of illicit funds are obscured through a series of complex financial transactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Lack of Transparency**: The firm’s difficulty in providing adequate documentation or explanations for the transactions can indicate attempts to mislead investigators or compliance teams. This diminishes trust in the legitimacy of the transactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the combination of a high volume of cross-border transactions, vague justifications, possible links to high-risk jurisdictions, inconsistencies with client activities, and overall lack of transparency raises alarm bells regarding the potential for Aurora Financial Services to be involved in money laundering activities. These patterns exemplify classic behavior associated with financial crimes where entities seek to obscure the trail of illicit funds.</div>"

       "\n",
       "1. **Irregular Transaction Patterns**: The mention of irregular transaction patterns implies that there are transactions occurring that deviate from normal market behavior. This could include sudden spikes in trading volume or transactions that happen close in time to significant company news or events, which could suggest that insiders have access to non-public information.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Rapid Fund Movements**: The rapid and unexplained movement of funds may point to deliberate efforts to manipulate stock prices or mask the source of funds from illicit activities. For example, a quick influx or outflow of capital can create artificial volatility in the securities market, which is a common tactic used in market manipulation schemes. Individuals with insider knowledge may swiftly reposition their investments in response to forthcoming news, thereby profiting unfairly.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Insider Trading Red Flags**: If transactions occur just before key announcements—such as earnings reports, mergers and acquisitions, or other material events—this can be a clear red flag for insider trading. Investigators would look for patterns where specific stocks see an unusual increase in trading volume or price movement preceding major announcements, which may suggest that insiders are trading on non-public information.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Lack of Transparency**: The absence of reasonable explanations for these transaction patterns, coupled with the high profile and ostensibly sophisticated investment strategies of Blue Horizon Investments, raises questions about the transparency of their operations. If the firm's transaction rationale isn’t clear or is obscured, this can be a sign of potential wrongdoing.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Comparison with Market Movements**: Analysts can compare the timing and volume of Blue Horizon Investments’ transactions against wider market trends and those of the relevant sector or industry. Significant deviations from the norm, especially when aligned with firm-specific events, may indicate manipulative practices such as \"pump and dump\" schemes, where prices are artificially inflated before insiders sell off their holdings.\n",
       "\n",

       "1. **Cybersecurity and Internal Audits:**\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank:** The bank is acclaimed for its cutting-edge cybersecurity, which not only protects customer data but also enhances operational integrity. Regular and rigorous internal audits reinforce its commitment to monitoring and improving compliance practices.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions:** Although not explicitly mentioned, the description does not highlight a strong cybersecurity posture or a systematic approach to internal audits. This lack of focus increases the risk of vulnerabilities and questionable practices regarding compliance.\n",

       "2. **Regulatory Environment and Practices:**\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank:** The description indicates that the bank has strong compliance practices and is trusted by both customers and regulators. This suggests that it operates within a robust regulatory framework and adheres to industry standards.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions:** In contrast, Helix’s strategy of partnering with unregulated advisors results in a \"patchwork\" of compliance practices, implying inconsistency and a higher risk of regulatory non-compliance.

       "3. **Reputation and Trust:**\n",
       "   - **Falcon Secure Bank:** Its reputation for transparency and strong compliance has helped it gain trust among customers and regulators, crucial for the perception of reliability in financial institutions.\n",
       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions:** The mention of potential fraud and mismanagement of client funds indicates that Helix has not yet built a solid foundation of trust and credibility, which can deter customers and regulators alike.\n",

       "   - **Helix Fintech Solutions:** The lack of clear operational transparency and the concerns about compliance suggest that stakeholders may struggle to obtain a full picture of Helix's practices, raising alarms about its overall governance.\n",

These differences significantly enhance the perception of Falcon Secure Bank as a leader in transparency and compliance within the financial sector.</div>"

This pattern raises concerns about potential money laundering for several reasons:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **High Volume of Transactions**: The unusually high volume of cross-border transactions could indicate attempts to move large amounts of money quickly across borders, a common tactic used in money laundering schemes to obfuscate the origins of funds.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Opaque Justifications**: The lack of clear and transparent explanations for these transactions raises red flags. In legitimate business practices, cross-border transactions typically have well-documented justifications that can be easily traced and understood. Opaqueness in justification suggests that there may be an attempt to disguise the true nature or purpose of the transactions.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Potential for Structuring**: A high volume of transactions might indicate structuring (also known as smurfing), where large amounts of money are broken down into smaller, less suspicious amounts to evade detection. This tactic is frequently employed in money laundering to avoid triggering reporting thresholds.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Regulatory and Compliance Concerns**: Financial institutions are required to maintain stringent compliance with anti-money laundering (AML) regulations. The patterns observed at Aurora Financial Services suggest a deviation from expected norms, prompting the need for further investigation to ensure compliance with these regulations.\n",

This could manifest as unusual spikes in trading volume or atypical buy/sell ratios that deviate from standard trading norms, raising suspicions of collusion or trading based on privileged information.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Rapid Fund Movements**: The rapid and unexplained movements of funds imply that there may be a lack of transparency in how investment decisions are being made. Such swift transfers can sometimes indicate that individuals are attempting to capitalize on non-public information, which is a hallmark of insider trading. If funds are consistently moved just before major market announcements, it may suggest foreknowledge of those announcements.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Timing of Trades**: If transactions are timed closely around significant corporate events (such as earnings announcements, mergers, or acquisitions), it raises the possibility of insider trading. Market manipulation could also be a factor if the firm is trying to artificially inflate or deflate stock prices based on these trades.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Lack of Clear Justification**: The lack of explanations regarding why certain transactions are taking place can exacerbate concerns. Investors typically expect to see rational reasoning behind changes in trading behavior, so a lack of clarity can lead to further scrutiny and speculation about illicit activity.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Regulatory Concerns**: The raised concerns regarding insider trading and manipulation signal that regulators are paying close attention to Blue Horizon Investments. Frequent regulatory inquiries or compliance checks can indicate that previous practices may have raised red flags, warranting more extensive investigation into whether insider trading or manipulative tactics are indeed taking place.\n",
       "\n",

       "   - In contrast, **Helix Fintech Solutions** is characterized as a rapidly growing startup that partners with numerous unregulated advisors. This approach can lead to a fragmented compliance framework, where the varying standards of unregulated partners may undermine overall regulatory compliance and transparency. The mention of a \"patchwork of compliance practices\" suggests a lack of cohesive and robust compliance measures.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Compliance Practices**:\n",
       "   - Falcon Secure Bank is noted for its \"strong compliance practices,\" which is a direct indicator of adherence to regulatory expectations and the establishment of a trustworthy business model. Such practices could include regular compliance training for employees, the use of compliance technology, and clear protocols for addressing compliance issues.\n",
       "   - Helix Fintech Solutions, on the other hand, is undergoing internal reviews for \"potential fraud and mismanagement of client funds.\" The necessity for these reviews implies that the company is currently facing significant compliance challenges that could potentially harm its credibility and operational effectiveness. \n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Reputation and Trust**:\n",
       "   - Falcon Secure Bank has earned \"the trust of its customers and regulators alike,\" illustrating a reputation built on reliability and compliance. Institutions with high transparency often cultivate positive relationships with both clients and regulatory bodies, which can be instrumental in building a sustainable business.\n",
       "   - Conversely, Helix Fintech Solutions, while a growing entity, is facing scrutiny and potential reputational risk due to concerns about fraud and mismanagement. This situation may hinder its ability to gain trust from both customers and regulators, affecting its overall perception in the market.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Ethical Standards**:\n",
       "   - The description of Falcon Secure Bank implies that its practices are tightly aligned with ethical standards, reinforcing its commitment to compliance and transparency.\n",
       "   - Although Helix Fintech Solutions is a startup in a dynamic industry, its choice to partner with unregulated advisors might raise ethical questions and concerns among stakeholders about the integrity of its operations.\n",

    "## Scalable Data Pipeline: Production-Grade Enhancements\n",
    "\n",
    "While our current pipeline successfully processes a moderate dataset, it has several limitations for large-scale, production-level use. Below are the key drawbacks of the current approach compared to a proposed, more scalable solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Drawbacks of the Current Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Memory Limitation**\n",
    "   - The current implementation uses a streaming method for parsing; however, any operation that attempts to load large files entirely into memory can create bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Scalability Issues in Embedding**\n",
    "   - Embedding all documents at once using `model.encode(corpus)` leads to:\n",
    "     - **High Memory Usage:** Processing large datasets in a single batch is memory intensive.\n",
    "     - **Slow Startup Times:** Repeated loading of the embedding model for large batches adversely impacts performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Index Management**\n",
    "   - **Current FAISS Index (IndexFlatL2):**\n",
    "     - Does not support incremental updates efficiently.\n",
    "     - Requires rebuilding the index on every application restart due to lack of persistence.\n",
    "     - Lacks sophisticated querying capabilities (e.g., metadata filtering).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Persistence**\n",
    "   - The in-memory mapping (`id_to_doc`) is not stored persistently, requiring the index and mappings to be rebuilt on every run.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Proposed Scalable Production Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome these limitations, the following production-grade, scalable solution is recommended:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Data Streaming and Chunking**\n",
    "   - Process the input file in smaller chunks or line-by-line to avoid memory bottlenecks.\n",
    "   - Store parsed documents in a structured format (e.g., JSONL or a dedicated database) for incremental processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Embedding Management**\n",
    "   - Implement batch embedding to conserve memory and allow incremental indexing.\n",
    "   - Embed documents in smaller batches and update the FAISS index progressively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Efficient FAISS Indexing**\n",
    "   - Switch from `IndexFlatL2` to a more advanced index type like `IndexIVFFlat` or `IndexHNSWFlat` to handle large-scale datasets.\n",
    "   - Persist the FAISS index to disk for quick reloading, avoiding complete rebuilds with each restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Persistent Storage for Metadata**\n",
    "   - Use a persistent storage solution (e.g., SQLite, MongoDB, or Redis) to maintain document metadata and `id_to_doc` mappings.\n",
    "   - This approach supports incremental updates and provides a restart-friendly environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of the Proposed Pipeline\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalable Data Handling:**  \n",
    "  Processes documents incrementally, thereby efficiently managing memory and compute resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Persistent Storage:**  \n",
    "  Both the FAISS index and document metadata are saved to disk, eliminating the need for frequent re-indexing.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Optimized Query Performance:**  \n",
    "  Advanced FAISS index types and persistent metadata enable faster, more robust query handling with filtering options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Production Readiness:**  \n",
    "  The scalable architecture is designed to handle real-world workloads, ensuring better performance, maintainability, and robustness.\n",
    "\n",
    "This enhanced pipeline significantly improves scalability and efficiency, paving the way for deployment in production-level environments."
